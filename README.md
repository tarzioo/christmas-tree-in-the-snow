# Christmas Tree in the Snow

I wanted to make a little christmas tree. My niece and I started on this last night. We created it all except for the snowfall, it was taken from Nicky Christensen https://codepen.io/NickyCDK/pen/AIon. I'm still learning a lot when it comes to the frontend, so I really enjoy making little fun projects to build my skills.
